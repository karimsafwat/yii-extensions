This widget encapsulates the JEditable library in a CInputWidget, so the
widget can be used in CForm definitions.

The saveurl parameter expected by JEditable defaults to $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] if not provided in the config of the widget.

The submitted parameter which contains the id defaults to 'attribute' so as not to collide with the $_GET parameter, which usually decides which record you're editing.

I haven't tested any of the other content types besides text, but assume it should work transparently, since the parameters are passed through pretty much verbatim.
