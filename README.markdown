This repository houses any Yii extensions I've developed.

Currently the following extensions are hosted here:

jeditable - DsJEditableWidget - encapsulates a JEditable element into a CInputWidget, so it can be used in CForm definitions or anywhere in-place editing is required.

datetime - DsDateTimeWidget - encapsulates the [jQuery date entry plugin](http://keith-wood.name/dateEntry.html) and the [jQuery time entry plugin](http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html) from Keith Wood into a CInputWidget. Combines the 2 fields into one value to capture date and/or datetime attributes on models.

crudify - a collection of components which together create an admin interface for your models, dynamically generating forms and grids based on metadata, or configurative methods on the model.
